## Getting Started with Create React App.

`npx create-react-app`

This command initialize a pre-configured
react project with `Jest` for testing `babel` to transpile React and ES6 to older versions of js in order to make it understandable to the browser, and
 some other dependencies like 
`web-vitals` that so far I don't really know what it does.

## React basics
React uses `JSX` notation which is kind similar to `html` so it's easy to learn and to understand nevertheless it has some markable differences, so far I know about:
- JSX can receive javascript inside `{}`
- HTML `<br>` ðŸ ² `<br/>` JSX
- HTML `class` attribute will be  `className` attribute in JSX in order to not interfer with the recerved keyword `class` of JS
- HTML `style` attribute will be receive an object as a value
    ```jsx
        function Wave(){
            const username = 'Harry';
            return(
                <section className="wave">
                    <h2 style={{
                        //Properties with a - must be write with camelcase
                        fontFamily: 'poppins', 
                        //Variables must be strings
                        letterSpacing: '2px',
                        color: '#010101',
                        fontWeight: 'normal'
                    }}>
                        Hello
                        <br>
                        <b>
                        {username}
                        <b>
                    </h2>
                </section>
           );
        }
    ```

### Components vs Elements
A React apps are base in Components and elements.
- Elements\
`Elements` are what we see in the screen. 
- Components\
`Components` are composed of Elements, as well as, they're invisible to `HTML` but not to `React` which render the `Elements` inside of it.
\
&nbsp;

*Then what is the difference between `Elements` and `HTML` tags, aren't the same thing?*

The difference is that `Elements` are `JSX` that `Babel` transpile to `JS` which is create a HTML tag, even though in practice similar they aren't the same.

### Stateful and Stateless Components
Components received as parameter an object called `props` (as a good practice).
```jsx
    const username = 'Juan';

    render(
        <WaveUser 
            username={username}
        />
    );

```
```jsx
    function WaveUser(props){
        render(
            <h2>Hello {props.username}</h2>
        );
    }
    or
    function Waveuser({username}){
        render(
            <h2>Hello {username}</h2>
        );
    }
```
`props` contains variable that may not change in the lifecycle of the component.

### State
React provide us with a state which let us pass information to a component that could change with the user interaction.


### Stateful
```jsx
    import {useState} from 'react';

    function App(){

        //Using the useState() hook
        //And destructuring into an array of two values
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        //count will be the value of the state
        //setCount will be a function that may change the value of count

        const onClick = () => {
            const newCount = count+1;
            setCount(newCount);
        }

        render(
            <Counter
                count={count}
                onClick={onClick}
            />
        );
    }

```
### Stateless
```jsx
    function Counter({count, onClick}){
        render(
            <button
                onclick={onClick}
            >
            You pressed {count} times
            </button>
        );
    }

```
> stateful components [...] have state, while stateless components do not. This means that stateful components are better suited to keep track of and display our appâ€™s dynamic data, while stateless components are more often than not better suited to displaying more static information that they are given. [Stateful vs. Stateless Components in React JS](https://medium.com/@rachelbrandsness/stateful-vs-stateless-components-in-react-js-2811b67e6883))

## Good Practices 
- Use capitalize when declare a React component
- Use the state only when is necessary
- Separate the login from the UI
- Export a component with a fixed name 
    ```js 
    export { Counter }
    ```
## Project I'm developing
A basic todo app which design is from my authory so is suseptible to change.

(Probably the search button is unnecesary)
